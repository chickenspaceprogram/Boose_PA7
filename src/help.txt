The goal of Poker is to draw better cards than your opponent, who, in this 
implementation, is controlled by the computer. To do this, you must draw one of
several scoring combinations, listed below in order of precedence, from worst
(and most likely) to best (and least likely). 

If your combination is lower down on the following chart than that of the
computer, you win! If you and the dealer have the same combination of cards,
you tie, and if your combination is higher on this chart than that of the
dealer, you lose.
